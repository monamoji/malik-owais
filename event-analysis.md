The event package implements the event publishing and subscription mode within the same process.

## event.go

Currently this part of the code is marked as Deprecated, telling the user to use the feed object. However, it is still used in the code. And there is not much code in this part. Just a brief introduction.

The data structure TypeMux is the main use. Subm records all subscribers. You can see that there are many subscribers for each type.

Feed implements one-to-many subscriptions

```go
// TypeMuxEvent is a time-tagged notification pushed to subscribers.
type TypeMuxEvent struct {
	Time time.Time
	Data interface{}
}

// A TypeMux dispatches events to registered receivers. Receivers can be
// registered to handle events of certain type. Any operation
// called after mux is stopped will return ErrMuxClosed.
//
// The zero value is ready to use.
//
// Deprecated: use Feed
type TypeMux struct {
	mutex   sync.RWMutex
	subm    map[reflect.Type][]*TypeMuxSubscription
	stopped bool
}
```

Create a subscription that can subscribe to multiple types at the same time.

```go
// Subscribe creates a subscription for events of the given types. The
// subscription's channel is closed when it is unsubscribed
// or the mux is closed.
func (mux *TypeMux) Subscribe(types ...interface{}) *TypeMuxSubscription {
	sub := newsub(mux)
	mux.mutex.Lock()
	defer mux.mutex.Unlock()
	if mux.stopped {
		// set the status to closed so that calling Unsubscribe after this
		// call will short circuit.
		sub.closed = true
		close(sub.postC)
	} else {
		if mux.subm == nil {
			mux.subm = make(map[reflect.Type][]*TypeMuxSubscription)
		}
		for _, t := range types {
			rtyp := reflect.TypeOf(t)
			oldsubs := mux.subm[rtyp]
			if find(oldsubs, sub) != -1 {
