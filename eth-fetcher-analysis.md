Fetcher contains synchronization based on block notifications. When we received the NewBlockHashesMsg message, we only received a lot of Block hash values. The hash value needs to be used to synchronize the block and then update the local blockchain. Fetcher provides such a feature.
The same thing happens with swarm when we want to build a decentralized storage, each chunk corresponding to a hash. If we use swarm feed, we will deliver message directly so that the subscriber can check feed topic for update

data structure

```go
// announce is the hash notification of the availability of a new block in the
// network.
type announce struct {
	hash   common.Hash   // Hash of the block being announced
	number uint64        // Number of the block being announced (0 = unknown | old protocol)
	header *types.Header // Header of the block partially reassembled (new protocol)
	time   time.Time     // Timestamp of the announcement

	origin string // Identifier of the peer originating the notification

	fetchHeader headerRequesterFn // Fetcher function to retrieve the header of an announced block
	fetchBodies bodyRequesterFn   // Fetcher function to retrieve the body of an announced block
}

// headerFilterTask represents a batch of headers needing fetcher filtering.
type headerFilterTask struct {
	peer    string          // The source peer of block headers
	headers []*types.Header // Collection of headers to filter
	time    time.Time       // Arrival time of the headers
}

// headerFilterTask represents a batch of block bodies (transactions and uncles)
// needing fetcher filtering.
type bodyFilterTask struct {
	peer         string                 // The source peer of block bodies
	transactions [][]*types.Transaction // Collection of transactions per block bodies
	uncles       [][]*types.Header      // Collection of uncles per block bodies
	time         time.Time              // Arrival time of the blocks' contents
}

// inject represents a schedules import operation.
type inject struct {
	origin string
	block  *types.Block
}

// Fetcher is responsible for accumulating block announcements from various peers
// and scheduling them for retrieval.
type Fetcher struct {
	// Various event channels
	notify chan *announce	//announce
	inject chan *inject		//inject

	blockFilter  chan chan []*types.Block	 // channel of channels
	headerFilter chan chan *headerFilterTask
	bodyFilter   chan chan *bodyFilterTask

	done chan common.Hash
	quit chan struct{}

	// Announce states
	announces  map[string]int              // Per peer announce counts to prevent memory exhaustion. Key is the name of the peer, and value is the count of announce, in order to avoid memory usage is too large.
	announced  map[common.Hash][]*announce // Announced blocks, scheduled for fetching
	fetching   map[common.Hash]*announce   // Announced blocks, currently fetching
	fetched    map[common.Hash][]*announce // Blocks with headers fetched, scheduled for body retrieval
	completing map[common.Hash]*announce   // Blocks with headers, currently body-completing

	// Block cache
	queue  *prque.Prque            // Queue containing the import operations (block number sorted), priority queue
	queues map[string]int          // Per peer block counts to prevent memory exhaustion. Key is peer and value is the number of blocks.
	queued map[common.Hash]*inject // Set of already queued blocks (to dedup imports)

	// Callbacks
	getBlock       blockRetrievalFn   // Retrieves a block from the local chain
	verifyHeader   headerVerifierFn   // Checks if a block's headers have a valid proof of work
	broadcastBlock blockBroadcasterFn // Broadcasts a block to connected peers
	chainHeight    chainHeightFn      // Retrieves the current chain's height
	insertChain    chainInsertFn      // Injects a batch of blocks into the chain
	dropPeer       peerDropFn         // Drops a peer for misbehaving

	// Testing hooks
	announceChangeHook func(common.Hash, bool) // Method to call upon adding or deleting a hash from the announce list
	queueChangeHook    func(common.Hash, bool) // Method to call upon adding or deleting a block from the import queue
	// New model syncing (PV62), consider reputation of the sending node
	fetchingHook       func([]common.Hash)     // Method to call upon starting a block (eth/61) or header (eth/62) fetch
	completingHook     func([]common.Hash)     // Method to call upon starting a block body fetch (eth/62)
	importedHook       func(*types.Block)      // Method to call upon successful block import (both eth/61 and eth/62)
}
```

Start fetcher and start a goroutine directly. This function is a bit long. Follow-up analysis.

```go
// Start boots up the announcement based synchroniser, accepting and processing
// hash notifications and block fetches until termination requested.
func (f *Fetcher) Start() {
	go f.loop()
}
```

The loop function is too long. I will post an ellipsis version first. Fetcher records the state of announce via four maps (announced, fetching, fetched, completing) (waiting for fetch, fetching, fetch waiting for fetch body, fetch is done). The loop actually uses a timer and various messages to perform state transitions on the announcements in various maps.

```go
// Loop is the main fetcher loop, checking and processing various notification
// events.
func (f *Fetcher) loop() {
	// Iterate the block fetching until a quit is requested
	fetchTimer := time.NewTimer(0)
	completeTimer := time.NewTimer(0)

	for {
		// Clean up any expired block fetches
		for hash, announce := range f.fetching {
			if time.Since(announce.time) > fetchTimeout {
				f.forgetHash(hash)
			}
		}
		// Import any queued blocks that could potentially fit
		// This fetcher.queue caches the blocks that have completed fetch and waits to insert them into the local blockchain in order.
		height := f.chainHeight()
		for !f.queue.Empty() { //
			op := f.queue.PopItem().(*inject)
			if f.queueChangeHook != nil {
				f.queueChangeHook(op.block.Hash(), false)
			}
			// If too high up the chain or phase, continue later
			number := op.block.NumberU64()
			if number > height+1 { // to high, can not import this time
				f.queue.Push(op, -float32(op.block.NumberU64()))
				if f.queueChangeHook != nil {
					f.queueChangeHook(op.block.Hash(), true)
				}
				break
			}
			// Otherwise if fresh and still unknown, try and import
			hash := op.block.Hash()
			if number+maxUncleDist < height || f.getBlock(hash) != nil {
				// The height of the block is too low. Below the current height-maxUncleDist
				// or the block has been imported before
				f.forgetBlock(hash)
				continue
			}
			// i
